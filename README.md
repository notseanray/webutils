## webutils

This repo is for a small webserver to provide a random image from the requested url to fill placeholders when creating website layouts. In the future additionally it will support feeding random json or text data to test if webapps crash when the recieved input is different from expected.

I am horrible at Haskell but I find it very fun to work with so this project is just to play around a tiny bit with the language and will be expanded in the future.
